Play unblocked games on algebra smash - no download, free to play on your school device!

This is just currently in its alpha stage, but more achievements will be made in the future and more games will be added.
I originally made this for me and my friends so we could play these games together, but since it got popular, it started getting complicated with game requests and payments with ads and getting in trouble and the district blocking it and people requesting to become editors and... you get the idea.
